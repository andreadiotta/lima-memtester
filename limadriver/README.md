This is NOT the original lima driver code from http://limadriver.org/

It had been modified to better fit the purposes of the lima-memtester tool!

But you can have a look at the https://github.com/ssvb/lima-memtester/tree/historical-lima-driver-from-2013
branch, which has a backup of the original lima driver sources from 2013.
